# raycraft

There have been many Minecraft clones already, but this one is a little different. The goal of this project is to be a proof of concept implementation of a voxel building game that uses ray tracing instead of rasterization for rendering. It should demonstrate that realtime ray tracing is already viable in specific scenarios on today's consumer hardware.

## Requirements

- Linux or Windows
- Hardware support for `OpenGL 4.0`

## Implementation details

The implementation will be based on `OpenGL 4.0`. More details will follow as the project progresses.

## Todo

* Fix normals
* Support raytracing from inside world
* Modifying the world
* Navigating through the world
